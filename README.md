# Exhaustive-Dynamic-Programming-Problem
### Ryan Takata | ryan.takata@csu.fullerton.edu

To compile the source code files, I used the g++ and c++ compilers
```
g++ .\project_2_starter.cpp -o main
g++ .\project_2_dp.cpp -o main
c++ .\project_2_starter.cpp -o main
c++ .\project_2_dp.cpp -o main
```
The **main** section can be named anything. It will be the name of the executable.

To execute the executable:
```
.\main.exe
```
